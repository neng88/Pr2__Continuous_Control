## Methodology

This work implements the DDPG algorithm (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) to the 20 agents Reacher environment, as described in [_Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning_][ddpg-paper] (Lillicrap et al). The foundation of this code-base is from the [Udacity DRL `ddpg-bipedal` notebook][ddpg-repo]
